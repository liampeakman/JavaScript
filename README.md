# JavaScript
Web application broken into client and server sides.

### Overview 
In this assignment, your overall task will be to develop a web application that makes crime
statistics available to the user, based on the data set that we have previously discussed in
class and in the API guide. This initial document concerns the client side of the application, in
which you will query the API and present the information in a form that is helpful to the user.
Subsequently, you will be required to replicate the services that we are (and will be) providing
on the server side, but it makes no sense to talk about that until we have at least introduced
you to node.js.

The aims of this assignment are to:
• Introduce you to full web application development – both client and server side
• Provide experience in querying REST APIs and manipulating the results
• Provide experience in developing modern client applications
• Introduce you to developing modern data oriented REST APIs
• Provide experience in exposing a SQL database source as a REST API
• Provide experience in authentication and security
• Provide experience with application deployment
• Provide experience with modern web technologies including JS, React, Node.js and
MySQL.

In this specification, we will not be too prescriptive, but we necessarily have to focus around
some technologies, as otherwise we cannot support you in learning the material and
debugging problems. You should see the development of the client for this application as a
series of steps, with each one of those steps corresponding to an increase in sophistication,
and in the possibility of a higher grade. We will consider these in turn below, and you can get
more of an idea from the podcast which you find nearby on BB.
